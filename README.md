# Animal Shelter Starter

Animal Shelter Starter provides the foundation to use Salesforce for managing animals, treatments, conditions, housing and related activities.

The Solution Development team within Salesforce have configured Animal, Treatment, Condition, Adoption and Exercise objects, along with Flows and Automation which you can install and adapt to your requirements, in addition, these are already linked to standard objects within Salesforce, such as Contacts and Accounts.

Animal Shelter Starter is built to scale with your organisation, providing you with a foundation to begin managing your animals from rescue to recovery and beyond. Utilising the Salesforce platform, you will be able to take full control of your operations with the power of the worldâ€™s leading CRM.

This forked repo is for collaborating on work as part of the Salesforce.org Open Source Community Sprint events, part of the Open Source Commons program. For package development work, please see https://github.com/SalesforceLabs/AnimalShelterStarter
